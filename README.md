# Nova Collapsible Groups

Inspired by https://github.com/alexbowers/nova-categorise-resources. Makes Nova core theme navigation collapsible using core functionality of resources `$groups`. 
If you have lots of groups you might end up with a long list of resources. You can group them but again it will be a long list. 
With this package groups are displayed as collapsed menu items. All you need to do is keep using the `$groups` and install this package via:

```composer require tanmuhittin/nova-collapsible-groups```
